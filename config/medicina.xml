	Configuration file for FITS IDI creation
	========================================

	Fill this in with information about your telescope, sources etc.
	This will set up header values for your FITS file, and will set up
	the column data array sizes.
	
	It does NOT assign any values to the rows and columns of the
  binary data tables themselves. This should be done in a second step.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTES:
	================
  *All* text inside tags is run through python's eval() command.
  This means you can do some neat (i.e. super dodgy but pretty powerful) stuff, like:
    <EXAMPLE1> import ephem, datetime; ephem.julian_date(datetime.datetime.now()) </EXAMPLE1>
    <EXAMPLE2> numpy.rad2deg(numpy.pi/2) </EXAMPLE2>
    <EXAMPLE3> [x for x in range(0,10)] </EXAMPLE3>
  
  
  In fact, this file uses this to reference itself. In the pyFitsidi.py code, we have
  the following line, which makes a dictionary called 'params' by parsing this file:
    params = parseConfig('PARAMETERS', config)
  Later on in this XML file we reference this python dictionary:  
    <EXAMPLE4> params['NCHAN'] </EXAMPLE4>
  Of course, this means that we're parsing this file multiple times, and things could
  fail spectacularly if they're evaluated before other parts are parsed. So, be careful
  not to set yourself up the bomb.

  You also need to be careful, as doing something like this would be SUPER bad:
    <BADNESS>os.system('rm -rf *')</BADNESS>  
  
  Finally, note that strings need to be enclosed in '' so they pass through eval():
    <RIGHT>'MEDICINA'</RIGHT>     <- Parsed as a string with value 'MEDICINA'
    <WRONG> MEDICINA </WRONG>     <- Parsed as variable with id MEDICINA
    
	A final note: comments shouldn't live inside the child elements. I could relax this, but
	I would have to do more careful parsing (maybe one day).
	
	MORE DOCUMENTATION
	==================
	For more info on the FITS IDI file format, refer to:
	* AIPS Memo No. 102:  The FITS Interferometry Data Interchange Format;
	* AIPS Memo 114r: The FITS Interferometry Data Interchange Convention — Revised; and,
  * http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/fitsidi.html
  It will definitely help you fill this file out if you have a copy of the memo!

    PARAMETERS
    ==========
    
    A number of arrays have dimensions that depend on the parameters of the data set
    or of the table to which they belong. The notations used for these parameters are
    listed below (and in the FITS=IDI documentation)

    The values here are mainly used to help set up the table columns in the HDU.
    For example, if you had 8 bands, with 32 channels, then the UV_DATA table needs
    to know about this, and it should assign an array of size 8*32*2(real & imag)*32bits.

    Data Set Parameters
    nstokes The number of Stokes parameters in the data set
    nband   The number of bands in the data set
    nchan   The number of channels in the data set
    ntone   The maximum number of pulse-cal tones in a PHASE-CAL table
    norb    The number of orbital parameters in an ANTENNA_GEOMETRY table
    npoly   The number of terms in a delay polynomial in an INTERFEROMETER_MODEL table
    ntab    The maximum number of tabulated vals/terms for in a GAIN_CURVE table
    
    -->

    PRIMARY header
    ==============
    
    The primary HDU serves three purposes:
    1. It indicates that the file contains FITS-IDI data.
    2. It carries general information that applies to all of the FITS-IDI data in the file.
    3. It carries a record of the processing performed on the data up to the point that
       the file was written.
    
    You need to have these keywords with these values in your header. No exceptions.
    
    BITPIX   8
    NAXIS    0
    EXTEND   T
    GROUPS   T
    GCOUNT   0
    PCOUNT   0
    
    Information about the processing up to the point where the FITS file was created
    should be recorded in HISTORY records in the primary header.
    
    We're also going to add in the CORRELAT keyword, just for the hell of it (it doesn't
    really have a function at the moment)

    common header values
    ====================
    
    These values are shared across all tables and are mandatory.
    THESE SHOULD BE THE SAME FOR EACH TABLE AND SHOULD ONLY BE SET HERE!

    TABREV      Revision number of the table definition (normally 1)
    NO_STKD     The number of Stokes parameters
    STK_1       The first Stokes parameter
    NO_BAND     The number of bands
    NO_CHAN     The number of spectral channels
    REF_FREQ    The file reference frequency in Hz
    CHAN_BW     Channel BW in Hz for the 1st band in freq. group with freq. ID 1
    REF_PIXL    The reference pixel for the frequency axis
    RDATE       Reference date: the date for which the time params in ARRAY_GEOMETRY apply

    Each table also has a EXTNAME, but this is set up automatically so you don't
    have to worry about it.

    <!--
 
    ANTENNA table header
    ====================
    
    Not really that much to do here.
    
    The ANTENNA table contains information about the antennas used in a FITS-IDI
    file that may change with time or with frequency setup. These characteristics
    include the polarization properties of the feeds and the number of digitizer levels.

    NOPCAL      The number of polarised calibration constants
    POLTYPE     The feed polarisation parameterisation
    
    NOPCAL notes:
    The ANTENNA table may carry information about the polarization characteristics of the 
    feeds if this is known. If information about the polarization characteristics of the 
    feeds is contained in the table then the NOPCAL keyword shall have the value 2. If no
    information about the polarization characteristics is contained in the table then the
    NOPCAL keyword shall have the value 0.
    
    POLTYPE notes:
    If the table contains information about the polarization characteristics of the feeds 
    then the feed parameterization that is used shallbe indicated by the value of the POLTYPE
     keyword as given in Table 23. See “Feed Polarization” on page 17.
    ‘APPROX’ Linear approximation for circular feeds
    ‘X-Y LIN’ Linear approximation for linear feeds
    ‘ORI-ELP’ Orientation and ellipticity

    <!--
    
    ARRAY_GEOMETRY table header
    ===========================
    
    The ARRAY_GEOMETRY tables define the arrays used in the file. Each ARRAY_GEOMETRY table 
    lists the antennas that are part of that array together with their coordinates. It also
    provides information about the time system used for that array.
    
    EXTVER  Array number
    ARRNAM  Array name
    FRAME   Coordinate frame
    ARRAYX  x coordinate of array center in m (important, check the convention!!)
    ARRAYY  y coordinate of array center in m
    ARRAYZ  z coordinate of array center in m
    NUMORB  Number of sattelites. Normally safe to assume this is zero.
    FREQ    Reference frequency
    TIMSYS  Time system
    RDATE   Reference date
    GSTIA0  Grenwich Sidereal time at 0 hrs
    DEGPDY  The Earth’s rotation rate in deg per day
    UT1UTC  UT1 - UTC
    IATUTC  IAT - UTC
    POLARX  x coordinate of north pole
    POLARY  y coordinate of north pole
    
    GSTIA0, DEGPDY, UT1UTC notes: The default values for the time system 
    are taken from http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/fitsidi.html
    I haven't checked these are actually correct (on my todo list)! 
    
    ARRAYX, ARRAYY, ARRAYZ notes: The values below are for Medicina.
    These are VERY important and you'll have to change them. This might help:

  <!--
  
  FREQUENCY table header
  ======================
  
  The FREQUENCY table provides information about the frequency setups used in a 
  FITS-IDI file. 
  
  An important table, but not that much to do in the way of headers.
  
  -->
  
  <FREQUENCY>

  <!-- 
  
  SOURCE table header
  ===================
  
  The SOURCE table contains information about the sources for which data is available
  in the FITS-IDI file.
  
  Again, an important table but not that much config required for headers.
  
  -->
  
  <SOURCE>
    <EXTNAME>'SOURCE'</EXTNAME>
  </SOURCE>

  <!-- 
  
  UV_DATA table header
  ===================

  A UV_DATA table contains a set of visibility data matrices. If there is more than
  one UV_DATA table in the file then no two tables shall contain data for overlapping
  times and the tables shall appear in time order in the file1.
  
  This one is the biggest, most complicated and most important table. Spend a little time
  making sure you've got this right.
  
  TABREV  2: This should OVERRIDE the common value that we set above as 1
  NMATRIX 1: Don't think we've got a choice here
  
  The UV_DATA is a multidimensional array (6 levels in general)
  MAXIS   M = number axes in regular matrix
  MAXISm I Number pixels on axis m = 1 to M
  CTYPEm A Name of regular axis m = 1 to M
  CDELTm E Coordinate increment on axis m = 1 to M
  CRPIXm E Reference pixel on axis m = 1 to M
  CRVALm E Coordinate value at reference pixel on axis m = 1 to M
  
  Notes about the axes, with Medicina for an example:
  * first axis is complex, real imag
  * second axis is stokes, we only have 1
  * third axis is number of frequency chans (1024 for us)
  * this axis is the number of discrete bands (1 for medicina)
  * RA  - not really sure why they decided to make this an axis
  * DEC - this is part of the charm of FITS IDI

  Which column is the visibility matrix in? I've hard coded this to 11
  TMATXn L T — column n contains the visibility matrix

  Finally, some values that you might to change: 
  EQUINOX   Mean equinox (probably J2000)
  WEIGHTYP  Type of data weights
  DATE-OBS  Observing date
  TELESCOP  Telescope name
  OBSERVER  Observer’s name
  VIS SCAL  Visibility scale factor
  SORT      Sort order, * does no sorting (thus the quickest?)
