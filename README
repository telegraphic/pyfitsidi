pyFitsidi v 0.1
----------------

pyFitsidi is a python module that creates FITS IDI files. HTML documentation (generated with sphinx), can be found in docs/_build/html, or there is a PDF file equivalent in the base directory.

pyFitsidi is a collection of functions that create headers and data units that conform to the FITS-IDI convention. It was written primarily to convert data from a CASPER correlator into a format that can be imported into data reduction packages such as AIPS++ and CASA. 

The FITS Interferometry Data Interchange Convention (“FITS-IDI”) is a set of conventions layered upon the standard FITS format to assist in the interchange of data recorded by interferometric telescopes, particularly at radio frequencies and very long baselines.

HTML documentation (generated with sphinx), can be found at
<http://telegraphic.github.com/pyfitsidi/index.html>
or in docs/_build/html. There is also PDF documentation in the package.

Much more info on the FITS IDI convention can be found on its official page
<http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/fitsidi.html>. 

If you're not familiar with FITS files, you might also want to look at the actual FITS definition <http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&access=doi&doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201015362&Itemid=129>

pyFitsidi uses pyFITS for file I/O, so its worth getting familiar with pyfits

Finally, there are useful FITS resources at the NASA FITS website <http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_home.html>
